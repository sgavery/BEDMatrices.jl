#### To Implement
* change `NA_byte` to something more reasonable; for Float types change to `NaN`?
* other constructors: `n` and `p` instead of `.fam` and `.bim`, take an existing matrix `X`
* Use general form of `copy!` in `breakbyte!` to eliminate unnecessary `fourquarters` variable(s)
* Base.show to display missing value as `NA`?
* Test exceptions/invalid input
